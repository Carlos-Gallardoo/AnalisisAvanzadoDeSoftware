Requirements modeling through UML diagrams

----
1. Based on each of the user and system requirements established above for the
case study, write the requested modeling diagrams:



- A diagram containing the relationships between the different use cases, only for the scenario in which
the user interacts with the system making use of the main or central functions according to each case study. (Include at least 5 elements of the diagram)



- The sequence diagram that explains the communication between the different GUIs for the use cases of the previous point, considering that the user has already successfully entered the system. (Include as minimum 5 elements of the diagram)



- The class diagrams for the objects to be instantiated, for the aforementioned points.
(Include at least 5 elements of the diagram)
A package diagram containing the component diagrams and the relationships between the database data, user interfaces, controllers or intermediate layers - middleware. (Include at least 3
diagram elements)



- Distribution diagrams representing the physical structure of the system as can infrastructure
physical, networks, storage and web servers, firewall, mobile devices or any other resource
