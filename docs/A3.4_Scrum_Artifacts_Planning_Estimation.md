## Conclusions

 **Carlos Gallardo** 

At this point we begin to work with what our project sprints are (which are the deliveries that we are going to be making to the customer).
The most challenging part of this activity is to have the gantt chart that fits well with the days the sprint is expected to last, in addition to the fact that it has to consider what tasks can be carried out at the same time and it has to avoid leaving empty spaces of work. It is also important to consider that the tasks cannot be greater than 1 day of work. 

 **Yessica Orihuela**

This activity was a little more complicated than the others since the user stories were divided into small tasks, what was most complicated for us was the gantt diagram since the tasks must be well divided between the people who develop and within the scheduled delivery date. I consider that the scheduling of the schedule is very important in a software project since it must be contemplated when the project is going to be completed.
